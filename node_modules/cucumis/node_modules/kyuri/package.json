Vows was built from the ground up to test asynchronous code. It executes your tests in parallel when it makes sense, and sequentially when there are dependencies.\n\nInstead of crafting your VowsJS code from hand (using JavaScript), kyuri allows you to auto-generate Vows stubs. \n\n###Protip: \nkyuri is meant to be a low-level tool. if you want to compose Features and Scenarios using kyuri and a rich user-interface check out our other Node Knockout Entry, [prenup][2].\n\n\n## Authors\n### created by [Charlie Robbins][7] for Node Knockout 2010\n### big ups to [Jeremy Ashkenas][5] for being a languages black-belt and making [coffee-script][6]\n\n### [gherkin][8] is Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Mike Sassak, Gregory Hnatiuk, Aslak Hellesøy, see [GHERKIN.LIC][9] for more details.\n\n[0]: http://cukes.info \"Cucumber\"\n[1]: http://nodejs.org \"node.js\"\n[2]: http://github.com/nodejitsu/prenup \"prenup\"\n[3]: http://vowsjs.org \"VowsJs\"\n[4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development \"Behavior Driven Development\"\n[5]: http://github.com/jashkenas \"Jeremy Ashkenas\"\n[6]: http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script \"coffee-script\"\n[7]: http://github.com/indexzero \"Charlie Robbins\"\n[8]: http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin \"gherkin\"\n[9]: http://github.com/nodejitsu/kyuri/blob/master/GHERKIN.LIC \"GHERKIN.LIC\"\n",
